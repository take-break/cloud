 Miami is a melting-pot of culture and coffee. It started with the Cubans with cafe con leches and cafecitos. They give a tiny bit of gasoline to our evenings (no sitting down at work after an excursion to the Miami cafeteria after having one such). Then , there's people from the Europeans who have their French espressos and presses. South Americans arrived with arguably the finest beans in the world, and a love of coffee that is their own. In the end, the people from Seattle created an American tradition of coffee, which later led to local stores (shout out to Panther) producing all sorts of extravagant coffee drinks to pair along with our most-loved Miami breakfast sandwiches , as well as other hangover remedies. Today, you can enjoy an excellent cup of coffee in these amazing coffee bars in Miami and for those who rely on the drink can enjoy comparing Cuban variations of espresso pull with the local places that serve pour-overs made with beans that are roasted in the same place.

 It's where the bustle-and-bustle people eat their fill between court dates, meetings and all the other things that go in this fast-paced area in the capital city. It's the ideal place for those who feel the afternoon fog settling in and for those in a hurry to swiftly grab a cup of coffee at the take-away window. It's a Colombian coffee shop, which uses fresh beans in from Colombian growers. There are also beans from other important regions of coffee production in Ethiopia and Guatemala however we prefer the local bean that is delicious.

 Consider Wynwood and you'll likely remember the night that you left the pub only discover that the sun was up. Miam is a welcome respite from the chaos it's a bright and sunny cafe that has an excellent breakfast menu, a fully-stocked cafe, as well as a tranquil place to open your laptop, or have a chat with your friends for a jolt in the afternoon to make it through the day in Wynwood.

 Everything we like in Coral Gables you can find in Tinta y Cafe. It's local, quirky as well as deliciously Cuban. It's also quite laid back and you can enjoy the authentic Cuban coffee in the lunch crowd without having to battle various elderly men. It's also an ideal spot for a quick bite to eat. The place is the perfect example of a combination of its cafe and menu of delicious Cuban sandwiches.
